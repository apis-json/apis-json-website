<p>API discovery has not changed much since 2005, when <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/12/30/history-of-apis--programmableweb/">John Musser launched ProgrammableWeb</a>, the API directory we've all come to know and love. In 2014 (9 years later), we have <a href="https://www.mashape.com/">Mashape</a> and a handful of other API directory and discovery tools, but we have not made progress on truly being able to discover the best APIs possible, in a distributed, machine-readable way.</p>
<p>Steve Willmott of <a title="3Scale" href="http://3scale.net">3Scale</a>, and Kin Lane of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>, are at it again, looking to provide a possible solution, that we are calling APIs.json&mdash;a machine readable listing of your APIs and supporting building blocks that lives in the root of your domain.</p>
<p>The objective of APIs.json is to help fix this problem by making it easy for people to signpost where the APIs on a given domain are and provide information on how they work. The format is simple and extensible and can be put into any web root domain for discovery.</p>
<p>We are just getting started, so make sure and get involved via the <a href="https://github.com/api-commons/api-json">Github repository </a>or via the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/apisjson">Google Group</a> we've setup to facilitate discussion.</p>
