<p>One of our favorite events to attend is <a href="http://gluecon.com/">Gluecon in Broomfield, CO</a>. Eric Norlin and crew has done an amazing job of pulling together the leading technologists, into an intimate venue, where they can discuss the latest technology that acts as the glue of the Internet.</p>
<p>Following up on our <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/05/3scale-launches-api-commons-to-allow-developers-to-share-apis-under-creative-commons-licenses/">release of API Commons at Defrag</a>, we will be announcing <a href="http://apisjson.org/">APIs.json</a> at Gluecon. Eric&rsquo;s events, both Gluecon and Defrag, provide an excellent forum for not just generating awareness of new technologies, but also stimulating the discussion that is needed to push these technologies forward.</p>
<p>If you are at Gluecon, we'd love to hear your thoughts on APIs.json, and the general topic of API discovery and how we can begin to work together and establish a solution that works for the entire community.</p>
