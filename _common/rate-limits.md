name: Rate Limits
description: All APIs should possess rate limits that govern the amount of any digital resource or capability a consumer be able to access, with well-communicated, consistent, and enforced rate limits. Rate limits are what give API producers control over their digital resources, and are a fundamental aspect of how any type of APIs is publicly made available.
