description: Offering a standardized set of API support for consumers to tap into helps ensure that onboarding is as frictionless as possible while helping build trust with consumers. Support can be as simple as email, or as structured as a ticketing system, but whatever is offered, it should work to keep API consumers taken care of throughout their journey.
