name: Service Level Agreement
description: A service level agreement, or simply SLA, defines the level of service you expect from a vendor, laying out the metrics by which service is measured, as well as remedies or penalties should agreed-on service levels not be achieved. A SLA sets the tone between an API producer and consumer and can be communicated as part of API change management practices.
