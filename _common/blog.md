description: A blog is an essential communication tool for any API operation, providing a simple self-service way for API producers to keep their consumers up to date on any changes. An active blog is a quick way to get up to speed on what an API does and can easily be syndicated via RSS or Atom feeds, and can be used to broadcast to social media.
