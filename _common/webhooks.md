description: Webhooks are a way to communicate between applications by sending data to another application when an event occurs. Webhooks are HTTP-based callback functions that are automated and triggered by an event in a source system, then sent to a destination system, providing event-driven capabilities utilizing simple HTTP "reverse APIs".
